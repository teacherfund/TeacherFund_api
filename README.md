TeacherFund is a charity to support teachers in a way that encourages great teachers to stay, and potentially great teachers to choose teaching as a career path. This includes providing supplemental funds and supplies to school teachers in need.

This repository contains the code for the main TeacherFund api backend written with Koa. 

**This project is in very early development and as such, the structure/design is subject to change significantly and often.**
